        "\n",
        "This is a collection of vibration data from electric motor bearings. Bearings those small spinning parts that let machinery rotate smoothly. Think of a bearing like the axle in a wheel: it's got little metal balls inside that roll around, letting a shaft spin with barely any friction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why was this dataset created?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The researchers at Case Western Reserve University deliberately damaged bearings in different ways, then recorded how the motor vibrated as a result. They made tiny cracks of various sizes (ranging from 7 to 40 thousandths of an inch) in the bearings, then attached vibration sensors to measure what happened.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cracks of different mm sizes were introduced on the outer race, inner race, and the balls themselves.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The goal was to understand the relationship between bearing damage and vibration patterns, creating a reference library that shows what different types of bearing failure look like.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is it useful?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This data is incredibly useful for real-world maintenance and diagnostics. In factories and power plants, you can use vibration patterns to detect bearing problems before they cause catastrophic failures. By comparing vibrations from a running machine to patterns in this dataset, maintenance teams can identify early signs of wear, predict when a bearing will fail, and schedule repairs before expensive downtime happens. It's basically like a fingerprint database for bearing damage—once you know what a damaged bearing \"sounds like,\" you can spot trouble coming.\n",
        "\n",
        "**So what are we actually trying to predict?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Good question. We will try to train machine learning models to predict three things: 1) Is the bearing in normal operation? 2) If not, where is the crack? 3) And what size is it?\n",
        "\n",
        "2 and 3 of course become irrelevant if the bearing is in normal operation, but they allow us to go a step beyond simple detection of irregular operation.\n",
