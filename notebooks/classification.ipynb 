        "**What is this dataset?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a collection of vibration data from electric motor bearings. Bearings those small spinning parts that let machinery rotate smoothly. Think of a bearing like the axle in a wheel: it's got little metal balls inside that roll around, letting a shaft spin with barely any friction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why was this dataset created?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The researchers at Case Western Reserve University deliberately damaged bearings in different ways, then recorded how the motor vibrated as a result. They made tiny cracks of various sizes (ranging from 7 to 40 thousandths of an inch) in the bearings, then attached vibration sensors to measure what happened.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cracks of different mm sizes were introduced on the outer race, inner race, and the balls themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "![ball_bearing_diagram](https://www.globalspec.com/ImageRepository/LearnMore/20133/ball%20bearing5364b00280ef4db7b85dfba113f04556.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal was to understand the relationship between bearing damage and vibration patterns, creating a reference library that shows what different types of bearing failure look like.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is it useful?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This data is incredibly useful for real-world maintenance and diagnostics. In factories and power plants, you can use vibration patterns to detect bearing problems before they cause catastrophic failures. By comparing vibrations from a running machine to patterns in this dataset, maintenance teams can identify early signs of wear, predict when a bearing will fail, and schedule repairs before expensive downtime happens. It's basically like a fingerprint database for bearing damage—once you know what a damaged bearing \"sounds like,\" you can spot trouble coming.\n",
        "\n",
        "**So what are we actually trying to predict?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Good question. We will try to train machine learning models to predict three things: 1) Is the bearing in normal operation? 2) If not, where is the crack? 3) And what size is it?\n",
        "\n",
        "2 and 3 of course become irrelevant if the bearing is in normal operation, but they allow us to go a step beyond simple detection of irregular operation.\n",

        "A fully connected neural network treats each vibration sample as a fixed-length vector, learning relationships between all points in the signal simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike sequential models, it makes no assumptions about temporal ordering — every input element is connected to every neuron in the next layer, allowing it to discover arbitrary correlations across the entire 1200-point reading. The first layer projects the raw signal into a 512-dimensional space, expanding the representation to capture a rich set of features, while the second layer compresses to 256 dimensions, acting as a bottleneck that forces the network to distill the most discriminative patterns. ReLU activations between layers introduce nonlinearity, enabling the network to learn complex decision boundaries that a simple linear classifier could not. This architecture is well suited for vibration classification when the signal length is fixed and the spatial relationships between measurement points carry meaningful information about fault characteristics, as it is in this project.\n",

        "In the architecture, residual blocks are defined as a separate module class outside the main ResNet1D class and then used in aggregate within the network definition block. Let's look at the definition of the internal components of *ResidualBlock1D* to start. It operates in two modes, depending if the output shape differs from the input shape - then it is downsampling - or not. Looking at the components as they are defined in the forward pass:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `shortcut` is defined differently if the block is performing downsampling or not. If it is not, then the shortcut is simply a passthrough. If it is performing downsampling, then the input is downsampled to the output dimensions using conv1d with a stride of two to halve the input dimension to the needed output dimension. Note that the identity is used to cache the input identity for later, it is not passed further along the network (yet).\n",
        "* `conv1` A convolutional layer is applied, but critically only to every other input (stride=2) when downsampling. When every other input is skipped, it halves the length of the output. Batch norm, ReLu and dropout are applied after to normalize, incorporate non-linearity, and prevent overfitting respectively.\n",
        "* `conv2` is a second convolution to help refine the features again without changing dimensions. Batch norm and dropout applied afterward, but not ReLu.\n",
        "* `out += identity` is the key move that makes this 'res' net. The input that we cached at the start is added in at the end of the convolutional layers. The final ReLU activates the combined result before passing to the next block.\n",
        "\n",
        "> This addition of the input layers at the end of this block is the core idea of ResNet. Instead of the network learning the full transformation F(x), it only needs to learn the difference from the input: F(x) = H(x) - x, so the output is x + F(x), the residuals in res net. This means if the optimal transformation is close to doing nothing, the network just learns to push F(x) toward zero — which is much easier than learning a full identity mapping from scratch. This is why deep ResNets can train where plain deep networks collapse.\n",

        "To start, 32 one-dimensional [convolutional filters](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#convolutional_filter) are applied to the vibration signal. The convolution uses a wide 1-dimensional kernel (16 samples) to learn filter parameters capable of capturing broad structural features like impulse responses, periodic oscillations, and transient events at different scales from the raw input before passing them into the residual stages. This produces a new value from the filter for each part of the original time series, for each of the 32 filters that are learned - the output shape is 1199 (samples, one lost due to padding) by 32 (learned filters). BatchNorm normalizes each of the 32 channels independently to zero mean and unit variance across the batch, and then ReLu zeros out all negative values.\n",

They are arranged into four sequential groups, where each group halves the temporal dimension through stride-2 downsampling while progressively widening the channel count (32→32→64→128→128). The kernel size also steadily shrinks across groups (7→7→5→3), allowing later layers to learn increasingly fine-grained features now that earlier layers have already built up broad contextual awareness.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Each time a group downsamples, the temporal resolution is cut in half (e.g. 1199→600→300→150), but each remaining position now represents a wider window of the original signal. Combined with the residual connections carrying forward earlier representations, this means deeper blocks operate with an increasingly large receptive field. Each value in the compressed network is influenced by a broader stretch of the original vibration signal, allowing the network to pick up on longer-range structural patterns that wouldn't be visible at finer temporal scales.\n",

        "`AvgPool1D` is the adaptive average pooling layer collapses whatever temporal dimension remains (e.g. 150 time steps) down to a single value per channel by averaging across the entire length. This produces a fixed-size vector of 128 values — one summary statistic per learned feature channel — regardless of the original input length. This is what allows the network to transition from convolutional feature extraction into the fully connected classification heads.\n",

        "`fc_shared` is a fully connected layer that takes the 128-dimensional pooled vector and maps it to another 128-dimensional representation, followed by ReLU and dropout. It acts as a shared bottleneck that gives the network a chance to learn a final combined representation before branching into the three separate classification heads. Without it, each head would be working directly from the pooled convolutional features — this extra layer lets the network learn a task-aware remixing of those features that benefits all three outputs jointly.\n",

        "### Results Interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "ResNet's good performance makes sense due to the architecture's natural fit for vibration signal classification. Vibration signals contain diagnostic information at multiple scales — high-frequency transients from crack impacts, medium-frequency resonance patterns, and longer-range periodic structures from rotating components. The progressive downsampling through residual groups means the network builds up representations at each of these scales, from fine-grained waveform features in early layers to broad structural patterns in deeper ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "The residual connections also help here specifically. Subtle fault signatures can be small perturbations on top of dominant healthy vibration patterns — which is essentially what a residual is. By learning differences from the input rather than full transformations, the network is well-suited to detecting these small but diagnostically meaningful deviations. A healthy signal passes through with near-zero residuals, while a fault introduces learnable differences that propagate through to the classification heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "The multi-head design also plays a role. Because detection, location, and size classification share the same learned feature backbone, the network can exploit correlations between tasks — for instance, certain frequency signatures that indicate a crack also carry information about where it is. This shared learning likely gives better results than training three separate models, especially when data is limited.\n",

        "### Model Background and Concept\n",
        "\n",
        "The ResNet1D architecture described above processes a signal by sliding learned filters across it. Each convolutional layer looks at a fixed-width window of the input at a time, and the network builds up longer-range awareness by stacking many such layers and progressively compressing the temporal dimension. The key insight is that every position in the signal is treated somewhat independently; context is gathered implicitly through depth and receptive field growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recurrent networks like the GRU we build in this section, and the LSTM in the next, take a fundamentally different approach. Rather than scanning a signal with fixed filters, a series of cells read it sequentially and pass a hidden state that acts as a running memory of everything seen so far.\n",

        "Note: *With a univariate time series, the 3x1 input vectors above are actually just 1x1 vectors representing the reading at that point in time.*\n",
        "\n",
        "This \"hidden state\" sounds a lot more mysterious and shadowy than it really is. Like most things in deep learning, it is just a vector. Each cell receives the hidden state passed from the previous cell and updates it to pass to the cell after it. This means later time steps have direct access to a sort of learned compressed memory of steps that came before it - that is the principle that unites recurrent architectures.  However, it is in the updating of a new hidden state where vanilla RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs differ from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **vanilla RNN** updates the hidden state a simple linear combination of the hidden state and the input value(s). The same set of weights and biases are shared across all cells, so the network learns which values are best to shape the hidden state through the sequence. While this is conceptually clean, it breaks down in practice because the same update rule is applied at every step and gradients decay rapidly as they are propagated back through many time steps, making it very difficult for the network to learn dependencies that span long stretches of the sequence. This is known as the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

        "We can understand the steps like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the hidden state and the input are concatenated together to produce a new vector. This concatenated vector is the base input to everything that happens inside the cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "From here, there are two effectively parallel streams, we will call them *reset* and *update*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reset-1. This concatenated vector is then passed to the *reset gate* and *update gate*, both of which are small fully connected layers that reduce the concatenated vector back down to the length of the hidden state vector, while also applying sigmoid activations (0 to 1) on each output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reset-2. The reset gate output is then multiplied elementwise with the previous hidden state. The result is a version of the previous hidden state with some values scaled down or zeroed out, which is effectively deciding how much of the old memory is relevant when computing what to write next. That keep and forget pattern is what the fully connected layer in the reset gate aims to learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reset-3. The output of step 3, the reset-gated hidden state, is concatenated back onto the original input and sent to another small fully connected layer with a TanH activation function (-1 to 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "For the update path:\n",
        "\n",
        "Update-1. The concatenated vector is also fed into the *update gate*, another small fully connected layer with each output getting a sigmoid activation. This produces another vector of values between 0 and 1, one per hidden state dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "Update-2. The update gate output controls the final blend between the old hidden state and the candidate new hidden state produced by the reset path. It does this in two parallel multiplications:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The candidate hidden state from Reset-3 is multiplied elementwise by the update gate output z\n",
        "- The original previous hidden state h_t-1 is multiplied elementwise by (1-z)\n",
        "\n",
        "These two results are then added together to produce the new hidden state h_t. Where z is close to 1 for a given dimension, the new candidate content dominates. Where z is close to 0, the old hidden state is carried forward nearly unchanged. This is the core memory mechanism of the GRU — the update gate is learning when to update and when to preserve, for each dimension of the hidden state independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "The new hidden state h_t is the final output of the cell. It is passed forward to the next cell in the sequence as its received hidden state, and after the last cell in the sequence has processed the final time step, this hidden state represents the GRU's compressed memory of the entire input — which is what gets passed to the fully connected layers for classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Reminder: With all this mention of passing the hidden state from cell to cell, it would be easy to think that each cell has it's own set weights for its learned reset and update gates, but that is not the case. The reset gate weights and the update gate weights are shared across all cells and learned across all cells. What is happening in a GRU then is more akin to a loop with one set of values going around the loop (the shared/hidden state) and another set of values being injected at the start of each loop, the input at time step x (and also, loop x). This keeps the parameter count manageable regardless of sequence length, a GRU processing a sequence of 1000 steps has exactly the same number of parameters as one processing a sequence of 10 steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Anatomy\n",
        "\n",
        "The actual implementation of the GRU in Pytorch is quite simple as all of the complex mechanics described above are internal to PyTorch's `GRU` module, which is the first thing we implement in the GRU model class:\n",

        "* An **LSTM** takes a similar approach but with more machinery. It introduces a separate *cell state* that runs alongside the hidden state as a second memory channel, and uses three gates rather than two to manage it. This additional structure gives the LSTM more expressive control over long-range memory, at the cost of more parameters and slower training. In practice the GRU and LSTM perform similarly on many tasks, and the GRU is often preferred when training efficiency matters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The practical tradeoff between recurrent and convolutional architectures is real. Recurrent networks capture temporal order explicitly and handle variable-length sequences naturally, but the sequential dependency between cells makes them harder to parallelize during training. Convolutional networks are more efficient but require careful architectural design — stacking, downsampling, widening — to build up the same contextual reach that a recurrent network gets more directly.\n",
